# E3.2: County Calendar Scraper

**Epic:** E3 - Multi-Source Integration
**Story ID:** E3.2
**Story Points:** 5
**Priority:** P1 (High)
**Type:** Feature
**Status:** ⏸️ Blocked

---

## User Story

**As a** developer
**I want to** scrape events from Nevada County government calendar
**So that** I can aggregate a third source

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Implement `src/scrapers/county.py` with `CountyScraper` class
- [ ] Inherit from `BaseScraper` abstract class
- [ ] Check for iCal export option (use `icalendar` library if available)
- [ ] Fallback to HTML scraping if no iCal
- [ ] Extract same fields as other scrapers
- [ ] Set `source_name = 'county'`
- [ ] Return normalized event dictionaries
- [ ] Unit test with sample data
- [ ] Document scraping approach

---

## Investigation Tasks

1. Locate county calendar URL
2. Check for iCal/RSS export links
3. Scrape sample (iCal preferred, HTML fallback)
4. Assess kid-relevance filter needs

---

## Priority Order

iCal > RSS > HTML (in order of implementation ease)

---

## Dependencies

**Depends on:** E2.6 (Orchestrator)
**Blocks:** E3.3 (Deduplication), E3.4 (Parallel Scraping)

---

## Definition of Done

- [ ] County scraper returns 20+ events
- [ ] Fields match other scrapers
- [ ] Unit test passes
- [ ] Can run: `python -m src.orchestrator --source county`
- [ ] Documentation explains scraping method

---

## Technical Notes

**Format:** Unknown (investigate iCal vs HTML)
**Expected:** Lower kid-relevance (government/senior events mixed in)

Use findings from E1.3 (Evaluate County) to inform implementation. May need extra filtering for kid-relevant content.
