# E3.1: Library Calendar Scraper

**Epic:** E3 - Multi-Source Integration
**Story ID:** E3.1
**Story Points:** 5
**Priority:** P1 (High)
**Type:** Feature
**Status:** ✅ Complete

---

## User Story

**As a** developer
**I want to** scrape events from Nevada County Library
**So that** I can aggregate a second source

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Implement `src/scrapers/library.py` with `LibraryScraper` class
- [x] Inherit from `BaseScraper` abstract class
- [x] Determine optimal scraping method (RSS vs HTML parsing)
- [x] Extract same fields as KNCO scraper
- [x] Handle library-specific HTML structure
- [x] Set `source_name = 'library'`
- [x] Return normalized event dictionaries
- [x] Unit test with sample data fixture
- [x] Document scraping approach in code comments

---

## Investigation Tasks

1. Check for RSS feed option first (easier)
2. If HTML: Use BeautifulSoup with CSS selectors
3. LibCal may have structured JSON API (investigate)

---

## Dependencies

**Depends on:** E2.6 (Orchestrator)
**Blocks:** E3.3 (Deduplication), E3.4 (Parallel Scraping)

---

## Resolution (2025-10-07)

**Issue:** Library scraper was returning 0 events with live data

**Fix Implemented:**
1. **Added Selenium with headless Chrome** - Implemented browser automation to handle JavaScript-rendered content
2. **Automatic List view navigation** - Scraper clicks the "List" tab on page load to access structured event data
3. **Updated HTML parsing** - Now correctly targets `<li>` elements within `#CID81` calendar container
4. **Proper field extraction** - Parses `subHeader` div for date/time/venue and `icalDescription` for event details

**Current Status:**
- ✅ Successfully scrapes 97+ events from live site
- ✅ All required fields populated (title, description, date, time, venue)
- ✅ Selenium + webdriver-manager handles ChromeDriver automatically
- ✅ No changes needed to unit tests (they continue to pass with fixtures)

**Dependencies Added:**
- `selenium>=4.15.0`
- `webdriver-manager>=4.0.0`

---

## Definition of Done

- [x] Library scraper returns 20+ events
- [x] Fields match KNCO format
- [x] Unit test passes
- [x] Can run: `python -m src.orchestrator --source library`
- [x] Documentation explains scraping method

---

## Technical Notes

**URL:** https://nevadacounty.librarymarket.com/events
**Format:** LibCal HTML (may have RSS option)
**Expected:** High kid-relevance (library programs)

Use findings from E1.2 (Evaluate Library) to inform implementation.

## Dev Agent Record

### Implementation Summary
- Implemented `LibraryScraper` class using HTML scraping (LibCal system)
- LibCal uses JavaScript templates but renders server-side HTML
- Scrapes from: https://nevadacountyca.libcal.com/
- Extracts: title, description, date, time, venue, audience, categories
- All library events marked as free (is_free=True)
- Successfully integrated with EventOrchestrator

### Files Changed
- `src/scrapers/library.py` - New LibraryScraper implementation
- `src/scrapers/__init__.py` - Export LibraryScraper
- `src/orchestrator.py` - Add library to AVAILABLE_SOURCES
- `tests/test_library_scraper.py` - 9 unit tests
- `data/samples/library_sample.html` - Test fixture

### Test Results
- 9/9 library scraper tests passing
- 39/39 total project tests passing
- Test coverage: event parsing, field extraction, data validation

### Scraping Method
Selenium with headless Chrome + BeautifulSoup - Page requires JavaScript to render calendar events in list view. Scraper automatically clicks "List" tab and parses `<li>` elements from `#CID81` calendar container.
