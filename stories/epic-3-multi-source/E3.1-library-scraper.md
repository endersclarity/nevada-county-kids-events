# E3.1: Library Calendar Scraper

**Epic:** E3 - Multi-Source Integration
**Story ID:** E3.1
**Story Points:** 5
**Priority:** P1 (High)
**Type:** Feature
**Status:** ⏸️ Blocked

---

## User Story

**As a** developer
**I want to** scrape events from Nevada County Library
**So that** I can aggregate a second source

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Implement `src/scrapers/library.py` with `LibraryScraper` class
- [ ] Inherit from `BaseScraper` abstract class
- [ ] Determine optimal scraping method (RSS vs HTML parsing)
- [ ] Extract same fields as KNCO scraper
- [ ] Handle library-specific HTML structure
- [ ] Set `source_name = 'library'`
- [ ] Return normalized event dictionaries
- [ ] Unit test with sample data fixture
- [ ] Document scraping approach in code comments

---

## Investigation Tasks

1. Check for RSS feed option first (easier)
2. If HTML: Use BeautifulSoup with CSS selectors
3. LibCal may have structured JSON API (investigate)

---

## Dependencies

**Depends on:** E2.6 (Orchestrator)
**Blocks:** E3.3 (Deduplication), E3.4 (Parallel Scraping)

---

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Library scraper returns 20+ events
- [ ] Fields match KNCO format
- [ ] Unit test passes
- [ ] Can run: `python -m src.orchestrator --source library`
- [ ] Documentation explains scraping method

---

## Technical Notes

**URL:** https://nevadacounty.librarymarket.com/events
**Format:** LibCal HTML (may have RSS option)
**Expected:** High kid-relevance (library programs)

Use findings from E1.2 (Evaluate Library) to inform implementation.
