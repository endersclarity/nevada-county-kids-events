# E1.3: Evaluate Nevada County Calendar

**Epic:** E1 - Source Research & Evaluation
**Story ID:** E1.3
**Story Points:** 3
**Priority:** P0 (Critical)
**Type:** Research/Spike
**Status:** âœ… Done

---

## User Story

**As a** developer
**I want to** scrape a sample dataset from Nevada County government calendar
**So that** I can assess event volume, quality, and kid-relevance

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Fetch at least 20 events from county calendar
- [x] Extract all available fields
- [x] Document metadata completeness
- [x] Calculate kid-relevance ratio (expected: lower than library)
- [x] Measure scraping difficulty (1-5 scale)
- [x] Check for iCal export option (easier than HTML scraping)
- [x] Store findings in `docs/source-evaluation.md` (County section)

---

## Technical Tasks

1. Locate county calendar URL
2. Check for iCal/RSS export links
3. Scrape sample (iCal preferred, HTML fallback)
4. Assess kid-relevance (may be low - government/senior events)
5. Document

---

## Technical Notes

- **Format:** Unknown (investigate iCal vs HTML)
- **Expected:** Lower kid-relevance (government/senior events mixed in)
- **Priority:** iCal > RSS > HTML (in order of ease)

---

## Dependencies

**Depends on:** None (parallel with E1.1, E1.2)
**Blocks:** E1.4 (Prioritize Sources)

---

## Definition of Done

- [x] Findings documented with metrics
- [x] Sample data stored
- [x] Recommendation: Include or skip for MVP?
- [x] Kid-relevance ratio calculated

---

## Notes

County calendars often mix community events with government meetings and senior activities. May filter poorly for kid content. Could be a candidate to skip for MVP if kid-relevance is <30%.

### Context Reference
- Story Context XML: `c:\Users\ender\.claude\projects\n8n\docs\story-context-E1.E1.3.xml` (Generated: 2025-10-07)

### Debug Log
- Found Nevada County calendar at https://www.nevadacountyca.gov/Calendar.aspx
- Confirmed iCal export available at https://www.nevadacountyca.gov/iCalendar.aspx
- Scraped 25 sample events using WebFetch tool
- Calculated kid-relevance ratio: 44% (11/25 events)
- Scraping difficulty: 3/5 (Medium - iCal export available but requires department selection)
- Documented findings in `docs/source-evaluation.md`

### Completion Notes
- **Kid-relevance:** 44% - significantly lower than library calendar (82%), as predicted
- **iCal Export:** Available with multiple department feeds (easier than library scraping)
- **Recommendation:** MEDIUM priority - consider as supplementary source if iCal proves easier than library automation
- **Key finding:** Most kid-relevant content overlaps with library calendar, creating potential duplicates
- **Sample data:** Stored in `data/samples/county_calendar_events.json`

### File List
- `docs/source-evaluation.md` (updated with County Calendar section)
- `data/samples/county_calendar_events.json` (new - sample event data)

### Change Log
- 2025-10-07: Completed Nevada County calendar evaluation
- 2025-10-07: Documented metrics and recommendation in source-evaluation.md
