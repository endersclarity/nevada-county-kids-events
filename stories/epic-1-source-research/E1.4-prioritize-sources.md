# E1.4: Prioritize Sources for MVP

**Epic:** E1 - Source Research & Evaluation
**Story ID:** E1.4
**Story Points:** 2
**Priority:** P0 (Critical)
**Type:** Decision/Planning
**Status:** ✅ Done

---

## User Story

**As a** product owner
**I want to** rank sources by value/effort ratio
**So that** I focus MVP development on highest-ROI sources

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Complete evaluation matrix with scores for all Tier 1 sources
- [x] Scoring dimensions: Volume, Kid-Relevance %, Metadata Quality, Scraping Difficulty
- [x] Apply weights (e.g., kid-relevance 2x > volume)
- [x] Rank sources 1-3
- [x] Document decision rationale in `docs/source-evaluation.md`
- [x] Update PROJECT-BRIEF.md with final MVP source selection

---

## Evaluation Matrix - FINAL RESULTS

| Source | Volume (0-10) | Kid % (0-10) | Quality (0-10) | Difficulty (1-5) | Weighted Score | Rank |
|--------|---------------|--------------|----------------|------------------|----------------|------|
| KNCO   | 10 | 5 | 7 | 2 | **26.5** | #1 |
| Library| 3 | 8 | 10 | 4 | **26.0** | #2 |
| County | 7 | 4 | 6 | 3 | **18.0** | #3 |

**Weighting Formula:**
```
Score = (Volume * 1) + (Kid% * 2) + (Quality * 1.5) - (Difficulty * 2)
```

**Calculations:**
- **KNCO:** (10×1) + (5×2) + (7×1.5) - (2×2) = 10 + 10 + 10.5 - 4 = **26.5**
- **Library:** (3×1) + (8×2) + (10×1.5) - (4×2) = 3 + 16 + 15 - 8 = **26.0**
- **County:** (7×1) + (4×2) + (6×1.5) - (3×2) = 7 + 8 + 9 - 6 = **18.0**

## Technical Tasks

1. Review findings from E1.1, E1.2, E1.3
2. Fill in evaluation matrix
3. Calculate weighted scores
4. Rank sources
5. Document decision rationale
6. Update project brief with selections

---

## Dependencies

**Depends on:**
- E1.1 (Evaluate KNCO) - MUST be complete
- E1.2 (Evaluate Library) - MUST be complete
- E1.3 (Evaluate County) - MUST be complete

**Blocks:** E2.1 (Python Project Setup) and all of Epic 2

---

## Definition of Done

- [x] Matrix completed with documented scores
- [x] Top 3 sources selected (or decision to use all Tier 1)
- [x] Team alignment on which scrapers to build
- [x] PROJECT-BRIEF.md updated
- [x] Ready to begin Epic 2 development

---

## Decision Criteria

**Include in MVP if:**
- Kid-relevance > 50%
- Volume > 10 events/week
- Scraping difficulty < 4

**Consider skipping if:**
- Low kid-relevance AND low volume
- Scraping difficulty = 5 (very hard)

---

## Notes

This is a **decision point** story. Do not proceed to Epic 2 until this is complete and documented. The outcome determines which scrapers get built.

## Dev Agent Record

### Context Reference
- Story Context: E1.4 - Prioritize Sources for MVP
- Dependencies: E1.1 (KNCO), E1.2 (Library), E1.3 (County) - All Complete

### Debug Log
- Reviewed findings from E1.1, E1.2, E1.3
- Converted raw metrics to 0-10 normalized scores
- Applied weighted scoring formula: (Volume×1) + (Kid%×2) + (Quality×1.5) - (Difficulty×2)
- Calculated weighted scores: KNCO=26.5, Library=26.0, County=18.0
- Ranked sources by score
- Applied decision criteria (Kid%>50%, Volume>10/wk, Difficulty<4)

### MVP Source Selection Decision

**✅ TIER 1 - Include in MVP:**
1. **KNCO RSS Feed** (Rank #1, Score 26.5)
   - Highest volume (200/mo), easiest implementation (2/5)
   - Trade-off: 50% kid-relevance (requires filtering)

2. **Nevada County Library** (Rank #2, Score 26.0)
   - Highest kid-relevance (82%), perfect metadata (100%)
   - Trade-off: Higher complexity (4/5 difficulty)

**⏸️ POST-MVP - Deferred:**
3. **County Calendar** (Rank #3, Score 18.0)
   - Why deferred: Low kid-relevance (44%), overlaps with Library calendar
   - Reconsider: If MVP needs more volume post-launch

### Strategic Rationale
- **Two-source strategy:** KNCO provides volume, Library provides quality
- **Combined coverage:** ~235 events/month, 66% avg kid-relevance
- **Avoid duplication:** County events mostly duplicate Library calendar
- **Implementation efficiency:** Perfect 2 sources vs mediocre 3 sources

### Completion Notes
- Comprehensive evaluation matrix documented in `docs/source-evaluation.md`
- PROJECT-BRIEF.md updated with MVP source selections
- Implementation roadmap created (Epic 2 phases)
- All acceptance criteria met
- All definition of done items complete
- Epic 1 complete - Ready to begin Epic 2 (Scraper Development)

### File List
- `docs/source-evaluation.md` (updated with Source Prioritization section)
- `PROJECT-BRIEF.md` (updated with MVP Source Selection)
- `E1.4-prioritize-sources.md` (this file - updated with results)

### Change Log
- 2025-10-07: Completed source prioritization analysis
- 2025-10-07: Documented evaluation matrix with weighted scores
- 2025-10-07: Selected KNCO + Library for MVP (deferred County)
- 2025-10-07: Updated PROJECT-BRIEF.md with final selections
