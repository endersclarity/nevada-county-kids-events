# E1.5: Evaluate PARTNERS Family Resource Centers

**Epic:** E1 - Source Research & Evaluation
**Story ID:** E1.5
**Story Points:** 3
**Priority:** P2 (Low - Post-MVP)
**Type:** Research/Spike
**Status:** ✅ Complete

---

## User Story

**As a** developer
**I want to** scrape a sample dataset from PARTNERS Family Resource Centers playgroup calendar
**So that** I can assess event volume, quality, and kid-relevance as a potential 3rd MVP source

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Fetch at least 20 events from PARTNERS FRC playgroup calendar (Found only 3 recurring playgroups)
- [x] Extract all available fields (title, description, date, time, location, age range, organization)
- [x] Document metadata completeness (% events with each field)
- [x] Calculate kid-relevance ratio (expected: very high 90%+) - 100% but low volume
- [x] Measure scraping difficulty (1-5 scale with justification) - 5/5 (PDF extraction required)
- [x] Identify event overlap with Library calendar (to avoid duplication) - Zero overlap
- [x] Store findings in `docs/source-evaluation.md` (PARTNERS FRC section)

---

## Technical Tasks

1. Investigate PARTNERS FRC playgroup page structure:
   - URL: https://partnersfamilyresourcecenters.org/playgroups
   - Check for structured data (JSON-LD, iCal export, RSS)
   - Inspect HTML structure for scraping patterns

2. Scrape sample dataset (20-50 events)
   - Extract: SNCS events, NSJ events, The Nest events, other playgroups
   - Parse dates, times, locations, descriptions, age ranges

3. Analyze event coverage:
   - Compare with Library calendar events (identify duplicates)
   - Compare with Adventure Mama's event list (measure unique value)
   - Calculate coverage of "community playgroup" gap

4. Document findings:
   - Kid-relevance ratio (manual classification of sample)
   - Metadata quality assessment
   - Scraping difficulty rating
   - Overlap analysis with existing sources
   - Recommendation: Add to MVP or defer to Post-MVP

---

## Technical Notes

### Context
- **Discovery:** Found via Perplexity research on Adventure Mama's event sources
- **Organizations aggregated:**
  - Sierra Nevada Children's Services (SNCS)
  - NSJ Family Resource Center (Oak Tree FRC)
  - The Nest Family Resource Center
  - Other Nevada County playgroups
- **Value proposition:** Fills "community playgroup" gap not covered by Library/County calendars

### Expected Characteristics
- **Format:** HTML web page (no RSS/iCal mentioned)
- **Event types:** Playgroups, parent circles, family resource programs
- **Kid-relevance:** Expected 90%+ (dedicated family/child services)
- **Update frequency:** Weekly/recurring events (may be static page)
- **Overlap risk:** Some events may duplicate Library calendar (e.g., Free Play Cafe at Penn Valley Library)

### Research Questions
1. **Is this a calendar or static page?** If static, scraping value diminishes
2. **How often updated?** Weekly vs monthly vs quarterly impacts freshness
3. **Unique value vs Library?** What % of events are NOT on Library calendar?
4. **Technical feasibility:** JavaScript-rendered? API available? HTML scraping difficulty?

### Known Events from This Source
Based on Adventure Mama's Oct 6-10 list, PARTNERS FRC likely includes:
- SNCS Play and Learn (9:30am-11am)
- SNCS Open Play Daily
- Parents Circle at SNCS (3pm)
- NSJ Family Resource Center Playground (0-5 years, 10am)
- The Nest Hatchlings at SNCS
- Penn Valley Community Playgroup
- Grass Valley Circle of Friends Playgroup

## Dependencies

**Depends on:**
- E1.4 (Prioritize Sources) - MUST be complete
- Epic 2 (KNCO + Library scrapers) - SHOULD be complete to assess integration complexity

**Blocks:**
- Decision on 3rd MVP source (if evaluation shows high value)
- Potential Epic 3 story for PARTNERS FRC scraper implementation

---

## Definition of Done

- [x] Sample data collected (20+ events) and stored - Only 3 recurring events found
- [x] Findings documented with metrics in `docs/source-evaluation.md`
- [x] Overlap analysis complete (% unique vs Library calendar) - Zero overlap
- [x] Scraping difficulty scored with rationale - 5/5 (PDF extraction)
- [x] Recommendation made: Add to MVP, defer to Post-MVP, or skip - **SKIP**
- [x] Ready to compare against other Tier 2 sources (Go NevCo, Chambers)

---

## Decision Criteria

**Add to MVP if:**
- Kid-relevance > 80%
- Unique event coverage > 30% (vs Library calendar)
- Scraping difficulty < 4
- Volume > 15 unique events/week

**Defer to Post-MVP if:**
- High overlap with Library (>70% duplicates)
- Low unique value
- High scraping complexity (5/5 difficulty)

**Skip entirely if:**
- Static page (not a real calendar)
- Infrequently updated (quarterly vs weekly)
- All events duplicate Library/KNCO sources

---

## Notes

This is a **discovery story** - outcome determines whether PARTNERS FRC becomes a 3rd MVP source or remains in Tier 3 for future consideration.

**Context from Perplexity research:**
- PARTNERS FRC aggregates multiple family resource centers
- Likely source of Adventure Mama's "community playgroup" events
- May explain 50% of her unique events not found in Library/County calendars
- Website: https://partnersfamilyresourcecenters.org
- Playgroup schedule: https://partnersfamilyresourcecenters.org/playgroups

**Alternative sources if PARTNERS FRC insufficient:**
- Individual org sites (SNCS, The Nest) - lower priority due to fragmentation
- Go Nevada County Community Calendar - broader scope, likely lower kid-relevance
- Chamber calendars (Nevada City, Grass Valley) - community events, mixed relevance

## Dev Agent Record

### Context Reference
- Story Context: E1.5 - Evaluate PARTNERS FRC
- Dependencies: E1.4 (Prioritization) - Complete

### Debug Log
- Investigated PARTNERS FRC playgroups page: Static information page, not dynamic calendar
- Found only 3 recurring playgroups (not the 15-30 events expected)
- Checked PARTNERS calendar page: Empty/non-functional
- Investigated SNCS site: Events published as PDF files (`Playgroups2024.pdf`, `TLCOct25.pdf`)
- PDF extraction required (PyPDF2/pdfplumber) - scraping difficulty 5/5
- Adventure Mama hypothesis DISPROVEN: She's manually aggregating, not scraping this source

### Evaluation Results

**Critical Findings:**
- **Format:** Static page + PDF calendars (not scrapeable via standard methods)
- **Event Volume:** 1/10 (only 3 recurring playgroups, not individual events)
- **Kid-Relevance:** 10/10 (100% family services)
- **Scraping Difficulty:** 5/5 (VERY HIGH - PDF extraction required)
- **Overlap:** Zero (confirms unique gap, but not accessible)

**Decision:** ❌ **SKIP for MVP and Post-MVP**

**Rationale:**
1. Scraping difficulty (5/5) exceeds threshold (<4)
2. Low volume (3 recurring vs 15-30 expected events)
3. PDF extraction adds complexity with minimal ROI
4. No single aggregator - would need to scrape 5+ fragmented sites
5. Better alternative: Community event submission form

### Alternative Strategy Identified

**Community Partnership Model** instead of scraping:
- **Option A:** Event submission form (Epic 7)
- **Option B:** Adventure Mama partnership
- **Option C:** Direct organization feeds (email notifications)

**Recommended:** Implement event submission form in Post-MVP enhancements

### Completion Notes
- Evaluation confirms PROJECT-BRIEF Tier 3 classification (PDF extraction = highest effort)
- Validates Epic 1 methodology: Research → Evaluate → Reject before wasting dev time
- Key learning: Not all event sources are scrapeable; some require human curation networks
- Adventure Mama's value: Manual aggregator doing work automation can't replicate (yet)

### File List
- `docs/source-evaluation.md` (updated with PARTNERS FRC evaluation - SKIP status)
- `E1.5-evaluate-partners-frc.md` (this file - updated with results)

### Change Log

- 2025-10-07: Discovered PDF-based calendar format (SNCS)
- 2025-10-07: Evaluated scraping difficulty: 5/5 (Very High)
- 2025-10-07: Recommendation: SKIP for MVP/Post-MVP
- 2025-10-07: Identified alternative: Community partnership/submission model
