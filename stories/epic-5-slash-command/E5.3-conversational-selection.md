Agent: Found 28 events. How would you like them?
  1. Email (your-email@gmail.com)

  3. Google Calendar (Primary Calendar)
  4. Show here

User: 2

## Dependencies

## Technical Notes

This story makes the UX conversational vs purely CLI-based. Claude Code handles the interactive part, but the orchestrator must format options properly.
