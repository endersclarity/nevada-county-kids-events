# E5.2: Command Orchestration

**Epic:** E5 - Slash Command Interface
**Story ID:** E5.2
**Story Points:** 3
**Priority:** P0 (Critical)
**Type:** Feature
**Status:** ⏸️ Blocked

---

## User Story

**As a** developer
**I want to** parse command arguments and execute workflow
**So that** the slash command triggers the full pipeline

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Update `EventOrchestrator` with `execute_command(args)` method
- [ ] Parse command arguments (--sources, --days, --delivery, --no-cache)
- [ ] Apply date range filter (next X days)
- [ ] Call scraping pipeline (with or without cache)
- [ ] If delivery method specified: Auto-deliver
- [ ] If no delivery method: Present options conversationally
- [ ] Return formatted summary for Claude Code to display
- [ ] Handle errors gracefully (show user-friendly messages)

---

## Execution Flow Example

```
User: /get-events --days 7
Agent: Fetching events for next 7 days...
Agent: [Scrapes sources]
Agent: Found 42 events from 3 sources (15 KNCO, 12 Library, 15 County)
Agent: How would you like to receive them?
  1. Email
  2. Telegram
  3. Google Calendar
  4. Show in terminal
User: 1
Agent: [Delivers via email]
Agent: ✅ Sent 42 events to your inbox!
```

---

## Dependencies

**Depends on:** E5.1 (Command Design), E3.5 (Quality Validation)
**Blocks:** E5.3 (Conversational Selection), E5.4 (Error Handling)

---

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Command args parsed correctly
- [ ] Date filtering works
- [ ] Scraping triggered
- [ ] Can auto-deliver if method specified
- [ ] Returns formatted output
- [ ] Integration test passes

---

## Technical Notes

The orchestrator becomes the main entry point. It should:
- Parse CLI args or command params
- Coordinate all subsystems
- Format results for Claude Code
